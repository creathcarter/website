          The sequel/update to &quot;When Lemmings Attack&quot; (see Projects 
          section). This project was created with a team of individuals for the 
          purpose of entering the Independant Game Festival. </font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
          a parody of the game &quot;Lemmings&quot;, the purpose of this title 
          was to plant traps in the paths of the Lemmings in attempt to stop them 
          from reaching the level exit. Each set of stages had a set &quot;theme&quot; for the Lemming appearance and surrounding environment, with the featured theme of the final demo being the Medieval Era.<br />
          This project was completed using Virtools Dev, which is a software application 
          that is used for graphical construction of engine, game and AI code, 
          in place of a programming langage. <br />
          <br />
        The project cycle lasted from April 2002 to September 2002.</font></p></td>
