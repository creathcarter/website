          Assault originally began as a Virtools physics test spawned by <a href="devlab.flashbangstudios.com" target="_blank">Matthew 
          Wegner</a><strong>.<br />
          </strong>I found the original test so entertaining I began generating 
          artwork for it at once. One thing lead to another and I went from conceiving 
          artwork, to thinking of the titles game design, and finally working 
          with Matthew to complete a fully realized demo to be submitted (at the 
          last possible second) to the 2004 Independant Game Developers Festival.

          Level design for Rolling Assault had two main requirements: Small file 
          size for internet accessibiliy, and modular design for easy level construction.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The majority 
          of the artwork in Rolling Assault was done in under 24 hours. Over the 
          course of approximately two weeks Matthew was able to hammer down the 
          majority of the content loading structure, fix nearly all critical bugs, 
          and implement all art content. Afterwards, there was a final stage for 
          touchup on level structure, as well as some refinining to the basic 
          level physics geometry and the creation of Level 1's boss, which resulted 
          in the current, playable alpha.<br />
          The project lasted from start to finish for no more than 1 month of 
          off and on work.<br />
