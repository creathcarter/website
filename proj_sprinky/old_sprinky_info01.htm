          (2003)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sprinky 
          is the second of two designs that began as a physics test by <a href="devlab.flashbangstudios.com" target="_blank">Matthew 
          Wegner</a><strong>.<br />
          </strong>Matthew created all game design, core game scripting and level 
          scenarios, design and construction. After seeing the playable title 
          in action I created art content and new menus for the submission to 
          the 2004 IGF.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The game 
          features a high learning-curve and can be difficult to proceed. Playing 
          the levels in order yeilds a logical progression of challenge and is 
          more rewarding. </font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Work Contributed:</font></strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><br />
          <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All art 
          content<br />
          Menu Scripting</font><br />
          <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
          The first segment (design and coding by Matthew) of work lasted approximately 
          3 days, full time.<br />
          The creation and implmentation of art content lasted for approximately 
          2 - 3 weeks, part time work, resulting in the currently playable beta.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original 
          design of the game featured levels using a color-coded system for gameplay 
          mechanics. Blue floors were available for tumbling, walking, jumping, 
          etc. While falling over on a purple-colored floor resulted in a game 
          over, and red floors could not have any contact at all.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The focus 
          when adding art content was to give a variation of environments for 
          the player to traverse, while keeping the original rules of surface 
          contact. This proved a challenge in that the seperate environment themes 
          did not carry the same logical communication as their color-coded counterparts. 
          Using a good amount of imagination and design, we had to find ways to 
          convey the same information to the player while making it both logical, 
          and at least semi-universal between all levels.</font></p>
